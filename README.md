# Persona
With the barrage of spam/scam calls and emails I decided I needed a fast way to produce Credit Card, SSN, and a name with which to play with these people.

## To Run
First you need golang installed<br>
You can run with "go run ." or you can build for your environment<br>
to run help:<br>
./persona or ./persona -h<br>
Welcome to help<br>
Command line usage is<br>
"go run . -t visa -q 1"<br>
Card Types:<br>
amex, dci, dcu, discover, jcb, mae, maeui, mc, visa (default "visa")<br>

To generate a persona:<br>
either "go run . -t visa -q 1"<br>
or<br>
"./persona -t visa -q 1"<br>

To save to a file just add "-w" and it will output to a file

Written in GO and will have a GUI to go with it soon.<br>

Future updates...<br>
-save persona for reference<br>
-gui
